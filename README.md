# Crowdfunding937

## Resources to help connect crowdfunders to Dayton entrepreneurs

Driving a stake into the ground to start thinking through this project.  Possible phases:

1. A feed combiner that can merge Dayton-relevant search results from existing crowdfunding sites like indiegogo, kickstarter, etc.

2. An attractive, human-viewable version of the combined feed

3. An interface for admins to manually curate the feed, if automated search is too dirty

4. An independently-hosted instance of a FOSS crowdfunding package

`scraping.ipynb` contains some preliminary tests of technique.  It's
an IPython Notebook.  Install IPython Notebook (possibly by means of
Anaconda Python) and run
